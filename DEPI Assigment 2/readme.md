# Weather Now 🌤️

A modern, responsive weather dashboard application designed to provide users with detailed weather insights. This project features a dark-themed user interface that displays current weather conditions, daily forecasts, and hourly updates.



## 📄 Project Description

This is a front-end web development project created as part of the DEPI Assignment. It demonstrates the use of HTML5 and CSS3 to build a complex layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid. The design focuses on usability and visual hierarchy, offering a clean look with a gradient-accented dark mode.

## ✨ Features

* **Current Weather Overview:** Displays the current temperature, location, and date.
* **Weather Details:** Specific cards for "Feels like," Humidity, Wind Speed, and Precipitation.
* **7-Day Forecast:** A horizontal grid showing the high/low temperatures and weather icons for the upcoming week.
* **Hourly Forecast:** A detailed list view of the weather changes throughout the day.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Fully adaptive layout that adjusts for tablets (max-width: 1200px) and mobile devices (max-width: 600px).
    * On mobile, the daily forecast becomes scrollable, and the layout stacks vertically for better readability.
* **Interactive UI Elements:** Includes a search bar, unit toggle button, and hover effects.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the web page.
* **CSS3:** Styling, Flexbox, Grid Layout, and Media Queries.
